* Deezer Backup

A Python script that exports all of your Deezer playlists. 


** How to use 

*** Create a Deezer app 

First you need to create an app that will have access to your Deezer account. 

1. Go to [[https://developers.deezer.com/myapps][your Deezer app page]]
2. Click the button "Create a new Application"
3. Fill in the form as follow shown below.

#+CAPTION: Form to create a new application on Deezer
#+NAME:   fig:deezer_app_create_form
[[./img/deezer_0.png][Create a new application]]

*** Define environement variables

Once the Deezer application has been created you'll be able to see your =Application ID= and =Secret key= (see below).

#+CAPTION: Deezer application informations
#+NAME:   fig:deezer_app_infos
[[./img/deezer_0.png][Application infos]]

You'll need to declare two environement variables to use the script: 

- =APP_ID=: should have the same value as the =Application ID= (see image above)
- =APP_SECRET=: should have the same value as the =Secret Key= (see image above)


Example: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
export APP_ID=277302
export APP_SECRET=290XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
#+END_SRC

*** Run Python script 

Once the previous operations has been completed you can run the script =deezer-backup.py=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
python deezer-backup.py
#+END_SRC

A web page will pop up asking for permissions to access your user data on the behalf of your app.
Note: if you already have authorized your app the page will be blank. In both cases, wait until a pop up appears saying 
that you can close the page. It might take a few minutes, be patient. Then go back to your console and quit the script (using =CTRL+C=). 

You can find the backup of your playlists in this directory under the folder playlists_<TIMESTAMP>.

Example: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
playlists_1524517907.135343/
├── 0.json
├── 1.json
#+END_SRC

Here we have 2 playlists saved. One file per playlist.
